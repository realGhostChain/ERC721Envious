Requirements

.. _start-the-project:

Install `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_, `node <https://nodejs.org/>`_, and `truffle <https://trufflesuite.com/>`_.

.. hint::
  
  During the development process, truffle@5.5.18 was utilized. Using other truffle versions may be prone to instability when running the ``coverage`` plugin.

Clone git

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/somegit.git
  cd ./envious/

Install dependencies

.. code-block:: bash

  npm install

Usage
*****

Compile smart contracts

.. code-block:: bash

  truffle compile

.. hint::

  During the development process, **Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)** was utilized. However, attempts to use Hardhat were unsuccessful due to the size of the generated bytecode. It is worth noting that despite using the same optimizer and optimization runs, Hardhat and Truffle produced different results.

Once the smart contracts are compiled, smart contract testing may begin.

.. code-block:: bash

  truffle test
  # OR
  truffle run coverage

Please explore ``./audits/slither/`` for every smart contract in this project or run `slither <https://github.com/crytic/slither>`_ independently.

.. code-block:: bash

  slither contracts/FILENAME.sol

Advanced users are strongly recommended to use `mytril <https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril>`_, which is considered one of the best tools for analyzing Solidity smart contracts.
